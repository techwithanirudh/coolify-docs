# Django

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.

Example repository [here](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify-examples/tree/django).

## Requirements
1. Set the base directory where your `reqirements.txt` and `manage.py` files are located.

> In the example repository, it is `/coolify`.

2. Add `gunicorn` to the `requirements.txt` file, [official docs](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/install.html).
3. Add `localhost` and your `domain` to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in `settings.py` file, [ official docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/settings/#allowed-hosts).

> `Localhost` is required for health checks to work properly.
