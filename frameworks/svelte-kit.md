# SvelteKit

Svelte Kit is a framework for building web applications of all sizes, with a beautiful development experience and flexible filesystem-based routing.

Example repository [here](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify-examples/tree/sveltekit).

## Static build (`adapter-static`)

You need to use `@sveltejs/adapter-static` ([docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-static)) adapter to build a static site.

1. Set your site to static `on` (under `Build Pack` section).
2. Set your `Publish Directory` to `/build`

## Node server (`adapter-node`)
You need to use `@sveltejs/adapter-node` ([docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node)) adapter to build a node server based SvelteKit app.

1. Set your site to static to `off` (under `Build Pack` section).
2. Set your `Start Command` to `node build`.
