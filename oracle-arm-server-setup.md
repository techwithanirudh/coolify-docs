# Oracle ARM Server Setup

If you are using `Oracle Cloud free ARM server`, you need to do a few extra steps to use it in Coolify, as a Coolify instance or just a remote server.

## Setup Root User
By default, you can't login as root user. You need to do the following steps to enable root user.

1. Switch to root user `sudo su -`
2. Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and change `PermitRootLogin` to `without-password`.
3. Restart ssh service `service sshd restart`
4. Add a public key to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` file which is also defined in your Coolify instance.

## Firewall Rules
By default, Oracle ARM server has a firewall enabled and you need to allow some ports to use Coolify.

For more details, check [this](./configuration.md#firewall) page.
