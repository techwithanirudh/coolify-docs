# Servers
## Types
- **Localhost**: the server where Coolify is installed.
- **Remote Server**: could be any remote linux server.

## Localhost
To be able to manage the server where Coolify is running on, the docker container of Coolify should reach the host server through SSH.

You can use localhost as a server where all your resources are running, but it is not recommended as high server usage could prevent to use Coolify.

:::info
You can use our [Cloud](https://app.coolify.io) version, so you only need a server for your resources. You will get a few other things included with the cloud version, like free email notifications, s3 storage, etc based on your subscription plan.
:::

   
## Remote Server
You can connect any type of servers to Coolify. It could be a VPS, a Raspberry PI or a laptop running Linux.

:::tip
We recommend [Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=VBVO47VycYLt) **(referral link!)**. They have very cheap but super powerful servers, in EU and US.
:::

### Requirements

1. Connectivity
   - SSH connectivity between Coolify and the server with SSH key authentication.
   :::info
   Your public key should be added to **root** user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

   If you do not have an SSH Key, you can generate on through Coolify with a simple button or you can generate one manually.
   :::
   - Root user access.
   :::info
   We are working on to use non-root user.
   :::
2. Docker Engine (24+)
   - Automatically installed from the UI, but you can install manually.

The only manual step you need to do is to place your SSH key on the server, into `root` user's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.

### Cloudflare Tunnels
You can also set to use Cloudflare Tunnels for your servers.

:::info
Coolify does not install cloudflared on your server, it needs to be done prior.

All it does is to add the right ProxyCommand (`ProxyCommand <ip / hostname> access ssh --hostname %h`) to all ssh connections.
:::


## Features
### Disk Cleanup threshold 
You can set a threshold in % for your / filesystem. If this percentage is reached, Coolify tries to cleanup a lot of unnecessary files from your server.

- Unused Docker Images (`docker image prune -af'`)
- Unsused Docker Build Images (`docker builder prune -af`)
- Stopped Docker Containers deployed by Coolify (`docker container prune -f --filter "label=coolify.managed=true"`)

### Wildcard Domain
You can set a wildcard domain (`example: http://example.com`) to your server, so you can easily assign generated domains to all the resources connected to this server.

Example: Your application UUID is `vgsco4o`.

If you have the example set, you will get the following FQDN: `http://vgsco4o.example.com`

If you do not have any wildcard domain set, Coolify will generate a [sslip.io](https://sslip.io) domain, which is free & magical domain that you can use anywhere. 

In this case, it will be: `http://vgsco4o.127.0.0.1.sslip.io`, where `127.0.0.1` is your server's IP.
