# Frequently Asked Questions

Here you can find answers to the most common questions, errors and problems.

## Permission denied (publickey)

Example: `Server is not reachable. Reason: root@host.docker.internal: Permission denied (publickey).`

Your Coolify instance cannot reach the server it is running on. During installation, a public key is generated to `/data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub` and automatically added to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

If it is not added, you can add it manually by running the following command on your server:

```bash
cat /data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

## Cloudflare Proxy activated but application is not reachable
You need to set your SSL/TLS configuration to at least `Full` in your Cloudflare dashboard.
