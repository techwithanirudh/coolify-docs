# Docker Compose

## Raw Docker Compose Deployment
You can set with docker compose build pack to deploy your compose file directly without Coolify's magic. It is called `Raw Compose Deployment`.

:::tip
This is for advanced users. If you are not familiar with Docker Compose, we do not recommend this method.
:::

### What to set?
To be able to use Coolify's monitoring feature and optionally Traefik, you need to set the following labels on your application.

```yaml
  labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - 'traefik.http.routers.zoc0g0g-0-http.rule=Host(`coolify.io`) && PathPrefix(`/`)'
      - traefik.http.routers.zoc0g0g-0-http.entryPoints=http
      - traefik.http.routers.zoc0g0g-0-http.middlewares=gzip
      - coolify.managed=true
      - coolify.applicationId=5
      - coolify.type=application
```

- `zoc0g0g-0-http` is a random string. You can set whatever you want.
- Set the `Host` rule to your domain / path necessary.
- `coolify` is the prefix for Coolify's labels.
- `coolify.applicationId` is your application id. You can find it on your application's General page at the `Docker Compose Content` input box (bottom page).
