# Docker Registries

You can easily push your built docker images to any docker registries with Coolify.

You just need to fill the `Docker Registry` fields in your service `General` configurations.

## Configuration
### Docker Image
If this field is set, Coolify will automatically push your built docker image to the specified docker registry.
> If the image is empty, Coolify won't push your built image.

### Docker Image Tag
If this field is set, Coolify will automatically push your built docker image with the specified tag to the specified docker registry + the git commit sha tag.

> If the tag is empty, Coolify only push your built image with the git commit sha tag.

## Docker Credentials

Docker credentials (from v4.0.0-beta.88) are used to authenticate with Docker registries to pull/push images.

If you want to authenticate Coolify with a Docker Registry:

1. Login on the server through SSH with the same user that configured for your server.

> Currently only `root` user is supported. Non-root users will be supported in the future.

2. Login to the Docker Registry normally: execute `docker login` command.

> You will be prompted to enter your Docker registry username and password/token - this can be varied depending on the Docker registry you are using.

Once you logged in, Coolify will automatically detect your credentials and use them.

## Swarm Mode
If you are deploying to a Swarm cluster, you need to make sure that your Docker Registry is accessible from all nodes in the cluster, workers and managers.
