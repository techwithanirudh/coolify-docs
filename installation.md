# Installation

Installation is automated with a single script.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```

You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/blob/main/scripts/install.sh).

The script will do the followings on your operating system:
- Install basic commands: `curl wget git jq jc`
- Docker Engine (24+)
- Configures proper logging for Docker Engine.
- Creates directory structure at `/data/coolify` for all the configuration files.
- Creates an SSH key for Coolify to be able to manage this server from itself at `/data/coolify/ssh/keys/id.root@host.docker.internal`.
- Install dockerized Coolify.

## Supported Architectures

`AMD64` and `ARM` architecture are supported.

:::tip
We recommend [Hetzner](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=VBVO47VycYLt) **(referral link!)**. They have very cheap but super powerful servers, in EU and US.
:::

## Supported Operating Systems

`Debian` based servers are supported, due to the installation script (Coolify
itself supports every OS that could run a Docker Engine). 

If you would like to have other, please consider [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/issues/new).

## Required CPU/Memory/Disk

Minimum required resources for Coolify:

- 2 CPUs
- 2 GBs memory
- 30+ GB of storage for the images.

It could run on smaller servers as well, but not recommended.

### Additional Resources

Based on what you would like to host additional resources (CPU, memory, disk) are needed.

Self-hosting could be heavy if you would like to run a lot of things.

But for example, I'm hosting most of my production stuffs on a server with:
```
- 8GB of memory (average usage 3.5GB)
- 4 CPUs (average usage ~20-30%)
- 150GB disk (usage 40GB)
```
Hosting the following things:
```
- 3 NodeJS apps
- 4 Static sites
- Plausible Analytics (for visitor analytics)
- Fider (feedback tool)
- UptimeKuma (uptime monitoring)
- Ghost (my newsletters)
- 3 Redis databases
- 2 PostgreSQL databases
```

## Uninstall

You can easily uninstall Coolify by stopping the following containers,
`coolify`,`coolify-db`, `coolify-proxy`, and `coolify-redis` or by executing the following script:

```bash
docker stop -t 0 coolify coolify-db coolify-proxy coolify-redis; docker rm coolify coolify-db coolify-proxy coolify-redis
```

You also need to cleanup all the docker volumes as well.

```bash
docker volume rm coolify-db coolify-redis
```

:::warning

The following command will delete EVERYTING related to your configurations, backups, etc.

:::

And delete all configurations in `/data/coolify`:

```bash
rm -fr /data/coolify
```
